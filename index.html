            <p style="text-align: justify-self unset"><b>SOPS (SOCIETY OF PROGRESSIVE STUDENTS)</b> is an independent society
                founded in 2024. The words &quot;Progressive&quot; and &quot;Students&quot; draw inspiration
                from the renowned PDSU group established by George Reddy, a respected
                student leader and social activist, in 1972. His enduring values serve as a
                guiding force for students and society at large. SOPS, led by a team of
                devoted professionals from diverse backgrounds, is resolute in its commitment
                to sponsoring education for disadvantaged students and supporting
                marginalized and impoverished groups with essential needs such as food,
                shelter, and clothing.</p>
